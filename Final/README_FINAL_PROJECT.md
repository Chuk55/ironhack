## Project Description
Farmer need to collect fruits in mass manually, which required a lot of time.

## Hypotheses / Questions
* How AI help farmer to sort out the fruits?


## Dataset
* https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset/
Total number of images: 90483.
Training set size: 67692 images (one fruit or vegetable per image).
Test set size: 22688 images (one fruit or vegetable per image).
Multi-fruits set size: 103 images (more than one fruit (or fruit class) per image)
Number of classes: 131 (fruits and vegetables).
Image size: 100x100 pixels.


## Analysis
* Multilayer Perceptron & Convolutional neural network

## Model Training and Evaluation
CNN- loss function and accuracy

## Conclusion
* accuracy 95%


## Future Work
Due to 13:00 on 11.03.2021 requested from lead teacher to change data set, time constrain including data collection, coding + train model + presentation slides + preparation, more analysis can be done in future.
Increase accuracy

## Workflow
*Dataset
Planning
Import Library
Gather data & process
Build CNN Model
Fit the Model
Evaluate
